I was in the middle of learning Ruby on Rails when an unexpected death in my immediate family.  It was an emotion experience. I didn't want to learn web development for a few weeks.  I eventually got weeks behind in my assignments as well as my blog posts.  Every time I thought about doing an assignment I couln't focus and felt like I wasn't absorbing the material as I was before.  It took a while to realize that I can reach out to my lead co-hort and request to change my status from full-time to part-time. The staff at Flatirion has been very considerate and supportive.
