In high school my parents always urged me to get a career in the healtcare sector or comuter science sector.  I can still hear my dad say computers are the future and knowing how to navigate through computer software is beneficial for my future.  I worked in the healtcare field for ten years as a pharmacy technician.  I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis  (autoimmune disease) at a young age.  my disease never hindered me in any manner. A couple years ago I began noticing limitations, lower body inflammation, sleepless nights, or all days naps. Working full-time as a pharmacy tech in the hospital setting began taking its toll on my body.   I began to find myself in a panic about my future career options.  I never thought that software development would be in my future.  My boyfriend is a software developer whom works from home.  He would periodically mention the perks of software development and working from home.  I started warming up to the idea of coding after doing some reading and getting a few free coding prep courses under my belt.  I was still hesitant about which online coding school to apply to as well as if I would go full-time or part-time.  Flatiron was the school I wanted to apply to but when was still the issue I was still indecisive about.  A sleepless night pushed me to apply to Flatiron Full-time online program.  The last few weeks have been an exciting, overwheming, head rush. The amount of resources available is somewhat overwhelming in itself.  The software development community I feel is one of the most transparent and helpful.
